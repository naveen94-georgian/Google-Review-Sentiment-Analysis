4 days ago,Jenny,loblaws,"We get curbside pick up currently and its very quick, easy and friendly."
6 days ago,Lana Kis,loblaws,"We usually cannot afford to buy food from such an expensive store.  But today we came to it because there was a huge queue in the neighboring wallmart, where we usually buy food.  We were shocked that there were so many expired, spoiled food in such a luxury, expensive store.  Berry, dragon fruit, star fruit, they were all spoiled.  they were wrinkled and stained.  My kids asked for a coconut.  It was difficult to choose not rotten, most of the coconuts had mold.  I chose the best one, but when I opened it at home, it turned out that it was rotten.  Disgusting!  The managers of this store are not doing their job.  I have not seen such a shame in the most inexpensive Sshop.  Shame!!!  Never again !"
a week ago,robert mansfield,loblaws,Went here to pick up some food for meal prep. Store had everything that I was looking for. Only downside was at cash. The belt was not cleaned off after the previous person had paid and the cashier was reading some paperwork while I was waiting for them to scan my items. They seemed to be more interested in what they were reading than customer service.

2 months ago,Shirley Morrison,loblaws,I was looking for the  Knorr1klm.  soup base yellow can red lid. No store that I went to had that product.  I saw online that Loblaws had it.  When I went there to my disappointment the gentleman help me look for it and it was not in the store.  I give Loblaws credit for not giving up.  When I asked the manager about it she sent me to her assistant manager and there was one more place to look and he found it. I purchased the product I was looking for. Thank you Loblaws for not giving up. And a special thank you to Glen for being so good and trying to help me find the product.

2 months ago,kenny hunter,loblaws,To expensive but otherwise good
2 months ago,ChocolateMonkeh,loblaws,"Usually come here for their bakery section, breads and antipasto. Its always clean and organized but on all occasions that I've been here I've encountered at least 1 really rude worker. -Today was my birthday and we picked up a plain vanilla cake, it was half frozen and for loblaws' reputation I wasn't expecting it to taste like a boxed cake, but it did. Could have probably gotten a better one for less at Walmart. Other than that I'd definitely keep coming back. I love their plant section as well."

4 months ago,cassandra wellington,loblaws,"I bought two dozen chestnuts last week.  I usually slice chestnuts open and roast them in the oven, but about half of them were so hard I couldn't even slice them. The ones that I could cut slice turned out to be rotten on the inside or would not peel at all after roasting. I ended up being able to eat 3 chestnuts and the rest went into the green bin. What a disappointment, especially since they're a seasonal item that I really look forward to."
4 months ago,chris stix,loblaws,Wayyyyyyyyy to expensive.
4 months ago,Mike Owen,loblaws,"The prepared foods in the deli area are better than almost any fast food restaurant. Primarily the wings, fingers, scalloped taters, all really great quality. Great staff as well. Just nice clean tidy respectfull place to shop.unlike the big store next door that throws good food away they reduce food to enjoy today, instead of throwing it away. For a family budget it's a really great option to buy canadian."

4 months ago,johann isopp,loblaws,The vegetable section is outragious! Filthy and picked over. The vegatables are days if not weeks old. The prices are criminal. They have done a good job merchandising for the upcoming holidays.

5 months ago,Christina Savoy,loblaws,In and out in 10 the way I like it
5 months ago,lifeislove notcolour,loblaws,decent place but needs to value their employees more ... ironic considering they own all the groceries shops and sell the same thing at different prices in their other shops ...strange place indeed ....
5 months ago,William Blackstock,loblaws,line ups tend to be long at this location.
5 months ago,amie mim,loblaws,"The safety protocols I must say have been the best thus far..in luding not only sanitize stations but also wash basins..and also noticed they keep traffic going one way..u can  only enter one door and only exit a different one door..
Although to be honest I have found the most processing gouging there..
Which in of it alone is wrong in every aspects of life during these tiring times"

6 months ago,Dee Sans,loblaws,"A clean grocery store with lots of options to choose from. They have a decent selection of foods for different cultures :) . It can be a bit pricey but that can be anywhere. Another added highlight is that they have a Magnotta winery boutique where you can pick up a nice wine (and for a really nice price point!) So if you're planning to host a dinner or don't want to go empty-handed to someone's party, this is your one-stop shop."
6 months ago,Soren Vaerum,loblaws,Great selection. They do not have a good covid plan in terms of check out. Rather than utilizing multiple line ups at the cashier's with social distancing they enforce a single line. This often causes long wait times.
6 months ago,Charlotte Brethour,loblaws,"Loblaws , is always safe because they clean between customers. No many of the other grocery stores do. Thank you for making my shopping experience less stressful."

6 months ago,Tyra Wadman,loblaws,"BEWARE THE KARENS!!!

Out of every Loblaws I've been to, this one is (by far) the best in presentation and quality. A bit pricier than other neighboring grocers, but for this location, I'd make the sacrifice for things that aren't brand name, like meat/deli.

They like to reduce waste- meaning anything they don't sell in time gets marked down (typically around 50% off) and whatever doesn't sell from that gets made into compost/slop or made as food donations (depending what it is of course).

The meat is fresh, and out of all the places I've tried seafood, theirs seems to be the freshest. The bakery/Patisserie has a delicious variety to choose from and there's even a little cafe at the end of their sushi/hot deli counter.

The beef I have is with the owner (whom I've never met in my time working there). He decided to cut everyone's hours. I thought I could have a future there, but just as I thought I could start making a living, he hired on two new bakery associates and tossed us one 4-hour shift a week. I understand students need work, but what about those who aren't living off of student loans?  I had to pinch pennies and eat small portions just to make sure I had enough to last me the whole month. I couldn't even afford the bus pass to continue working there.

And I'll never let that go. )8<"
6 months ago,Una,loblaws,I find loblaws way too expensive especially for veggies

6 months ago,Tara Alexander,loblaws,"A WIDE selection to suit every customer. Was nearly blown away by the extensive produce display and the clever layout. The cheese fridges are impressive to say the least as is the patisserie.
Advise to not shop if hungry. No need to ever head south with the options at this location."

5 days ago,Andrea Licznerska,no_frills,While their prices are generally lower than other grocery stores I have found it far too crowded during Covid with little to no social distancing. It is hit or miss at the self serve check out with staff cleaning between use. Not my first choice for grocery stores as I would rather drive out of the way for peace of mind!

a week ago,Robin Russell,no_frills,Was at no frills on march 27 2021 the two ladies working at self scan made it a point to come and stand right by us with her hands on her hips watching us scan. It made us feel like we were going to steal something. The one lady says your celery didnt scan and i said ya it did and i showed her. I thought it was very rude.i realize they are there to help you but it was a very uncomfortable feeling. Ive been to ther stores where you self scan and have never had that happen
a week ago,Mike S.,no_frills,Great store! Well-stocked. No lineup at the checkout. My only request would be to please carry ‚ÄúFontaine lean ground veal‚Äù and ‚ÄúPC blue menu turkey bacon‚Äù.
2 weeks ago,Samantha Ivy,no_frills,Not following any covid 19 protocols.
2 weeks ago,Tia Reid,no_frills,"The store itself is clean, the prices are good and the staff is generally awesome.

1) My cheif compliant is that some of said staff are not wearing masks. This is ridiculous and dangerous. We are in the middle of a pandemic. I'm aware some claim 'mask exemptions' and I know they need to work but please find alternate options so they do not need to be near the public.

2) Some of the masks the employees wear are just plain ineffective. They are either below the nose or ones that do not work. Why isn't their a policy?

3) Your store says 'no masks, no service'. So why isn't that true? Please let your employees enforce the mask policy.

I just got my nana back from treatment. I don't want to lose her because we had to get groceries and she got infected."

a month ago,Milton Perez,no_frills,The prices are very reasonable. And you can collect points . The employees and very friendly. Today I bought a pork pic Nick for only $7.80 About 7 to 8 lb and I'm making pull pork enuff to feed 6 to 8 people.
a month ago,Julie Croydon,no_frills,"Lots of parking and the employees are really helpful if you can't find something. The fresh fruit and vegetable aisle I'll always looks nice and for the most part the quality is good and there is lots to choose from. I rarely shop anywhere else other than no frills and except for one rude checkout person my experience has been very good, especially during covid."
a month ago,Christina Minici,no_frills,"I will NEVER shop in this location again. Aside from the constant sub standard quality for produce (buy something one day and rotten the next) I witnessed staff and customers gang up on a husband and wife because they didn't feel their mask exemption was legitimate. Staff did nothing to de-escalate the situation. If anything they involved and encouraged other customers to join in on the confrontation. The cashier who serving me then tried to engage me into the debacle and once I shut him down, the level of customer service dramatically changed after being deemed ""one of them"" ..his words. Should  be noted I was masked but did not agree with or join in on the bullying, name calling and swearing. Deeply disappointed."

a month ago,Roger Lowe,no_frills,"Have been to this No Frills often but less since COVID. Self serve terminals are too close to each other even though every other one is blocked, the space between the 2 rows is not conducive to taking a cart through and or keeping a safe distance.
Saw a customer in the store without a mask, not cool especially indoors.
Seemed like too many people in the store when I was there.

2 months ago,Michael Ladouceur,no_frills,"The better of the two no frills options in Barrie. Much bigger selection and fresher products it seems. Be wary of weekends. Because of location and time if week, you almost guaranteed to come across quite a few unsavory customers and large crowds (with little regard to social distancing); yet that's not the stores fault, just a warning."

In fact recently, I've had the management tell me that I was not allowed to purchase beyond a certain limit of an item,  and that he just told ""my husband"", another random Asian man who I not only do not know,  but didn't even see in the store. Furthermore there was no sign of such a limit,  otherwise I would have happily abided.  Perhaps I should be surprised that No Frills allows this type of behaviour in their stores,  but I'm definitely not in this day and age."

Although the management does not have an option in the employees exemption, they do have options when it comes to making this employee public facing, intermingling, and in contact with the public.

This demonstrates:
1. The management doesn't take this pandemic seriously.
2. The management doesn't care about the health and safety of their customers or the community.

I have been a regular weekly shopper of Joe's No Frills for the past 13 years, that stops today.."

13 hours ago,Fire Ethence,walmart,Packed to the brim. Not following covid protocols AT ALL!!! The international students employees and customers REEEEKED!!!!!!! Could smell them all through out the store! Walmart talk to them about personal hygiene PLEASE!!!!

a week ago,Michael Burnie,walmart,"It's a Walmart, so it is what it is. Problem is, this is a pretty bad Walmart as Walmarts go, primarily because shelves are often barren in the grocery and pharmaceutical sections. I've talked about this particular location to my friends that work in management positions at other Walmarts, and they tell me this location is a joke. I send them pictures like this and they can't believe it.

I really like the curbside pickup when they're on time, which is seldom. I don't believe the staff are to blame. I think it's poor management compounding with COVID.

I hate myself for going here but it's convenient and they do actually have good prices on some stuff."
2 weeks ago,Ian McLean,walmart,"For over 3 days they have been promising to fill my prescription for anti seizure medication. Everyday it's we will have it filled by tomorrow. When asking a pharmacist if they are acually fill it or not, I was hung up on. Very unrespective employees and management. Management is included because, I called back to file a complaint. Management placed me on hold for 20 mins. Then the call was picked up and hung up. They don't care as long as they get your money. Shoppers drug mart got the same prescription filled in less then 30 mins. Wasn't fun not having my meds for a day. So I won't be going into a Walmart for anything anymore."

a month ago,Anthony Lancaster,walmart,"I had an interview with this Walmart on Thursday February 25th 2021. As I waited to be interviewed a number of employees walked by not wearing their masks properly, and I saw two managers without one. When it came time to do the interview it turned out to be a group interview with 6 other individuals. When we were brought into the back and placed in the training room, which had a small table were we could not social distance. When I asked the manager how could this be loud I was told it was a none issue yet as of February 14th they had an employee test positive for Covid-19. Walmart is placing your life at risk so they can make money."
a month ago,Carol F,walmart,"My experiences shopping in this store have always been enjoyable. Shelves are always well stocked and the employees are very courteous and pleasant.  However, my experience with an employee in the produce section today was not so good.  I dropped something on the floor and I reached out to the closest employee for their assistance.  Not a word was spoken from the employee, just a disgusted look. Needless to say I felt terrible, but this person made me feel even worse."
a month ago,Tim D,walmart,"Update: Loss of price match and pandemic issues have forced me and others to shop where items are more affordable. Was always worth trip to Walmart. Not anymore, sadly.

This Walmart has been so supportive and helpful to me and others during this sudden and huge crisis. The staff continue to work hard and with positive attitudes. I'm greeted with smiles and ""good morning's"" as always has been. It means a lot to me and I'm sure others. Sam Walton would be very proud of Walmart Barrie North. Thank you all..üòá

Massive transformation!! This Walmart rocks!! Great staff, lots of room to navigate my scooter throughout. Fresh product and well stocked. Cashiers smile and do thier best to help, very important!! Finally.... price match is so important and allows me to eat healthier foods with limited fixed income. Thanks to all..üôèüëç"

The shelves are empty way too often though, and they are not enforcing covid measures at all these days. It doesn't seem like they are controlling the number of people in the store since I'm always squeezing through crowded aisles, and they don't enforce the arrows. I see customers without masks once in a  while and no one says anything! I actually forgot my mask once and walked in  passed by 3 employees who didn't say a word! Once I realized, I flew out of there lol"

2 days ago,Sandra Mantello,zehrs,"I never shopped at Zehrs before , I'm from brampton, I was very impressed with Zehrs.I like your store."
a week ago,Raja K,zehrs,"Found what I wanted, easily."
2 weeks ago,David Watson,zehrs,"I personally think this location is one of the best I've ever been to. Pre-pandemic, they had hand sanitizer near the cart pickup spot. Since the pandemic, they've done a wonderful job or regulating the flow of shoppers, creating queues or lines for checkout where a store employee can direct which lane to use, and providing a washing and sanitization station near the entrance.

We've also used this location for the PC Express program a lot, especially since the pandemic. I have to say, the staff on the PC Express team at this Zehrs are phenomenal! If you forget to add an item or two to your order and it's too late to edit your order, they will do their best to accommodate you, sometimes even checking while you wait for pickup (if you're amenable to it) if they have stock. They are always extremely friendly and polite, and really make you feel - whether on the phone, or in-person - appreciated as a customer. I always enjoy my interactions with this team.

Overall, I give this Zehrs location a five for the way the store is run, all the staff who work there, and the measures they have and continue to take to make their customers feel valued."
2 weeks ago,Lisa Kalanj,zehrs,"This store is by far the best and has some of the most amazing employees!!  Thank you so much for the help with my groceries today at 3pm at the self checkout, I am so thankful and appreciative for the community feel at this store, thank you, thank you, thank you:)"

a month ago,Rudy Persad,zehrs,Great place to shop
a month ago,Lindsay Patterson,zehrs,"I absolutely love this grocery store. They follow protocols, they have such a wide variety of selections of different foods. They have the fresh butcher and seafood, bakery and deli. They have a huge selection of cheeses. There prices are decent and generally have great sales.

They have a bathroom located in the top floor and a starburst in one corner for the thirsty shopper and if your hungry a hot deli on the other side.

Product is easily located and has a general fluidity that works for both customers/consumer/business.

My daughter wants to start shopping here because she says it has everything and way more of a selection than where she lives in Alliston and she thinks it's just amazing."

4 months ago,Paula Ballantyne,zehrs,This is my go to store and has been for many years. Since mask policy came into effect in stores I have seen Zehrs allow too many people shopping without a mask. Why is this allowed? Other grocery stores have zero tolerance. Wear a mask or shop somewhere else. I expect the same from Zehrs. Please protect your customers.

7 months ago,Kim Caldwell,zehrs,"Many times I've vowed to leave a review here after disappointing experience at this store - finally doing it! Multiple times I've found items ringing through at cashier NOT at the advertised sale price. I wondered if this was a tactic in the summer knowing seasonal residents aren't as likely to check their receipts? When I point the errors out, cashiers simply re-ring it through at the correct price but without even an apology. This has happened at several visits over the past couple of years. I've also been consistently disappointed throughout the pandemic with employees' behaviour - waiting until forced to to wear masks, and not respecting distance. Very different approach towards customers than I've seen at other stores - even the Zehrs on Bryne is more diligent and obliging."

They have a health food section, pharmacy, Joe Fresh clothing, a florist, a small butcher area (separate but attached to the meat department), and an alcohol section (wine and ciders plus limited selection of beer). Overall a well rounded store."

They don‚Äôt care if you have problems walking and nothing to protect from weather elements and walking where cars drive just because one way entrance and exit for the whole covid.

9 months ago,Paul McIntyre,zehrs,"For the most part I like this store except for the older ladies that are cashiers. Most of them have a bad attitude and are downright rude. The younger cashiers are polite and well mannered and the staff throughout the store are fantastic but once you go to cash out and you get one of those older ladies who don‚Äôt smile and look miserable, unhappy and make underhanded rude comments and they‚Äôre careful so they don‚Äôt ‚Äúseem‚Äù rude when they are. If they aren‚Äôt happy at their job they should look for another job. Worst zehrs for most miserable older ladies cashiers."
