a week ago,Raja K,"Found what I wanted, easily."
2 weeks ago,David Watson,"I personally think this location is one of the best I've ever been to. Pre-pandemic, they had hand sanitizer near the cart pickup spot. Since the pandemic, they've done a wonderful job or regulating the flow of shoppers, creating queues or lines for checkout where a store employee can direct which lane to use, and providing a washing and sanitization station near the entrance.

We've also used this location for the PC Express program a lot, especially since the pandemic. I have to say, the staff on the PC Express team at this Zehrs are phenomenal! If you forget to add an item or two to your order and it's too late to edit your order, they will do their best to accommodate you, sometimes even checking while you wait for pickup (if you're amenable to it) if they have stock. They are always extremely friendly and polite, and really make you feel - whether on the phone, or in-person - appreciated as a customer. I always enjoy my interactions with this team.

Overall, I give this Zehrs location a five for the way the store is run, all the staff who work there, and the measures they have and continue to take to make their customers feel valued."
2 weeks ago,Lisa Kalanj,"This store is by far the best and has some of the most amazing employees!!  Thank you so much for the help with my groceries today at 3pm at the self checkout, I am so thankful and appreciative for the community feel at this store, thank you, thank you, thank you:)"
3 weeks ago,Steve Bell,Lots of parking. Picked up some fresh seafood.
a month ago,Rudy Persad,Great place to shop
a month ago,Lindsay Patterson,"I absolutely love this grocery store. They follow protocols, they have such a wide variety of selections of different foods. They have the fresh butcher and seafood, bakery and deli. They have a huge selection of cheeses. There prices are decent and generally have great sales.

They have a bathroom located in the top floor and a starburst in one corner for the thirsty shopper and if your hungry a hot deli on the other side.

Product is easily located and has a general fluidity that works for both customers/consumer/business.

My daughter wants to start shopping here because she says it has everything and way more of a selection than where she lives in Alliston and she thinks it's just amazing."

4 months ago,Lil Anglin,Wonderful as always.
4 months ago,Paula Ballantyne,This is my go to store and has been for many years. Since mask policy came into effect in stores I have seen Zehrs allow too many people shopping without a mask. Why is this allowed? Other grocery stores have zero tolerance. Wear a mask or shop somewhere else. I expect the same from Zehrs. Please protect your customers.
4 months ago,Gregory Hanson,Store on big bay point rd. Did not have adequate  inventory  of sale item salmon on display. When inquired about item was told would have to wait for staff to come back to cover dept.  Large store for only 1 employee in a dept.

6 months ago,CEU MELO,It's an expensive store I don't often go there I must admit I don't have a budget for that kind of pricing so yeah once in a while they have a sale on something and I'll come in and buy it but that's about it

6 months ago,Larry Miller,You realy.dont want to know!!!@
7 months ago,Kim Caldwell,"Many times I've vowed to leave a review here after disappointing experience at this store - finally doing it! Multiple times I've found items ringing through at cashier NOT at the advertised sale price. I wondered if this was a tactic in the summer knowing seasonal residents aren't as likely to check their receipts? When I point the errors out, cashiers simply re-ring it through at the correct price but without even an apology. This has happened at several visits over the past couple of years. I've also been consistently disappointed throughout the pandemic with employees' behaviour - waiting until forced to to wear masks, and not respecting distance. Very different approach towards customers than I've seen at other stores - even the Zehrs on Bryne is more diligent and obliging."
7 months ago,Marquis Black,Great gorcery store
7 months ago,Verna Washington,They have a great variety of items in this store. Prices are a bit high though.

7 months ago,Frank Csikos,Fast and friendly service
8 months ago,Catherine Stokes,It was very expensive and they were not enforcing the safety protocols within the store. People were not social distancing and the staff was watching and not saying anything. It was not a good place to safely shop.
8 months ago,Mike McKenzie,"Merchandising has way gone downhill.  Prices missing from many products.  Some shelves empty on special items.  And that bell just has to go!

Increasing from 2 stars to 4.  Merchandising has improved with the new prIce signs and they have done a great job during the pandemic which is very much appreciated."
8 months ago,Kathryn Wilking,"Zehrs is so reliable! Well stocked, fresh fish and meat, huge pharmacy, organic section and (bonus) having a liquor isle, no need to wait in huge lines at the LCBO.
And flowers! Everything under one roof! P.s. they also gift bonus airmiles regularly = free food! Thank you!"

8 months ago,Steve K,Groceries are pricier than other stores
8 months ago,Dee Saumure,"Great selection, prices are on par with a larger retail chain (not a discount retailer). Wide isles but not a cluttered store. They have a good point system that gives you cash back on groceries! Friendly staff and a location that is close to home. They have a health food section, pharmacy, Joe Fresh clothing, a florist, a small butcher area (separate but attached to the meat department), and an alcohol section (wine and ciders plus limited selection of beer). Overall a well rounded store."
8 months ago,Jaydeep Patel,Awesome place for grocery shopping

9 months ago,Jackie Baechler,To pricey for me
9 months ago,Gerald Masney,It was ok
9 months ago,Shaun,It isxadequate. Selection always leans toward PC/No name products.
9 months ago,Rina T,Worse service from staff pouring rain nothing to cover myself and have to walk in the middle of the street to enter from other door. They don’t care if you have problems walking and nothing to protect from weather elements and walking where cars drive just because one way entrance and exit for the whole covid. They need to learn to help protect the custom not make them worse. The staff also has not a clue where anything is.
9 months ago,Reid Couture,"Clean, over priced, every item you want they have though."
9 months ago,Phil Smith,"Though some of the cash staff are great, this store seems to have the worst fruit and vegetable section I've seen in Barrie.   The store is in dire need of an uplift."
9 months ago,Paul McIntyre,"For the most part I like this store except for the older ladies that are cashiers. Most of them have a bad attitude and are downright rude. The younger cashiers are polite and well mannered and the staff throughout the store are fantastic but once you go to cash out and you get one of those older ladies who don’t smile and look miserable, unhappy and make underhanded rude comments and they’re careful so they don’t “seem” rude when they are. If they aren’t happy at their job they should look for another job. Worst zehrs for most miserable older ladies cashiers."
9 months ago,Sheri Tobin,Fresh food and friendly staff
9 months ago,Tammy Charrier,"Still managing self distancing protocols, line sometimes is long but waiting to keep everyone safe, is priority."

10 months ago,Grant Corkery,"This place really needs to renovate their bathrooms. For what they charge, they really need to renovate the washroom. I usage two young daughters and the times I have had to bring them in to the men's washroom I have ended up leaving the store and going home. Absolutely disguising."
