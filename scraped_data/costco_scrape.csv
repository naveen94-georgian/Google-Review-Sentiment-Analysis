a week ago,Rodney Whitfield,"I have to say I love Costco , but during this times, I believe they could have done more seeing how they are one of the few multi million dollar buisness to remain open , and you have to buy a membership to stay alive and eat in this country now ??? C'mon government of Canada let's think about that I support Costco but there is more they could have done ,and drawn in a few more members of thank full people when or if this ends ! C'mon Costco I would like to you help out the less fortunate, and drop the fees for a while till we as a country get back on our feet ! Member for a long time !!!"

I've alerted closer 2000 prints from them in just December alone and still waiting to hear back what they want me to do with the rest of my orders in future because with this kind of customer service I don't know if I ever want to order from Costco photo again...
