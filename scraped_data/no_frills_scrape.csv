2 days ago,Dina Brooks,"Best prices, clean store!"
5 days ago,Andrea Licznerska,While their prices are generally lower than other grocery stores I have found it far too crowded during Covid with little to no social distancing. It is hit or miss at the self serve check out with staff cleaning between use. Not my first choice for grocery stores as I would rather drive out of the way for peace of mind!
a week ago,judy bemrose,Great store very clean staff are Awsome and the Boss is always out and about making sure things are running smooth

a week ago,Robin Russell,Was at no frills on march 27 2021 the two ladies working at self scan made it a point to come and stand right by us with her hands on her hips watching us scan. It made us feel like we were going to steal something. The one lady says your celery didnt scan and i said ya it did and i showed her. I thought it was very rude.i realize they are there to help you but it was a very uncomfortable feeling. Ive been to ther stores where you self scan and have never had that happen
a week ago,Mike S.,Great store! Well-stocked. No lineup at the checkout. My only request would be to please carry ‚ÄúFontaine lean ground veal‚Äù and ‚ÄúPC blue menu turkey bacon‚Äù.
2 weeks ago,Samantha Ivy,Not following any covid 19 protocols.
2 weeks ago,Tia Reid,"The store itself is clean, the prices are good and the staff is generally awesome.

1) My cheif compliant is that some of said staff are not wearing masks. This is ridiculous and dangerous. We are in the middle of a pandemic. I'm aware some claim 'mask exemptions' and I know they need to work but please find alternate options so they do not need to be near the public.

2) Some of the masks the employees wear are just plain ineffective. They are either below the nose or ones that do not work. Why isn't their a policy?

3) Your store says 'no masks, no service'. So why isn't that true? Please let your employees enforce the mask policy.

I just got my nana back from treatment. I don't want to lose her because we had to get groceries and she got infected."

a month ago,Ana V calhoun,"Friendly,  I know some ppl who work there but, mask wise I fukn hate.  Honestly I don't think no one should be wearing masks it's not healthy for ur lungs cuz ur lungs can't get oxygen from masks.  We can shop without masks."
a month ago,Milton Perez,The prices are very reasonable. And you can collect points . The employees and very friendly. Today I bought a pork pic Nick for only $7.80 About 7 to 8 lb and I'm making pull pork enuff to feed 6 to 8 people.
a month ago,Julie Croydon,"Lots of parking and the employees are really helpful if you can't find something. The fresh fruit and vegetable aisle I'll always looks nice and for the most part the quality is good and there is lots to choose from. I rarely shop anywhere else other than no frills and except for one rude checkout person my experience has been very good, especially during covid."
a month ago,Christina Minici,"I will NEVER shop in this location again. Aside from the constant sub standard quality for produce (buy something one day and rotten the next) I witnessed staff and customers gang up on a husband and wife because they didn't feel their mask exemption was legitimate. Staff did nothing to de-escalate the situation. If anything they involved and encouraged other customers to join in on the confrontation. The cashier who serving me then tried to engage me into the debacle and once I shut him down, the level of customer service dramatically changed after being deemed ""one of them"" ..his words. Should  be noted I was masked but did not agree with or join in on the bullying, name calling and swearing. Deeply disappointed."
a month ago,Richard Fernandez,"Best prices,  great quality!"
a month ago,Marcus Levis,Staff here I find are great and friendly. Some times hard to find some products. Not a fan of their meat products.

a month ago,Colin Evans,How much is the lettuce?
a month ago,Mrs Jay,Friendly clean and helpful
a month ago,Roger Lowe,"Have been to this No Frills often but less since COVID. Self serve terminals are too close to each other even though every other one is blocked, the space between the 2 rows is not conducive to taking a cart through and or keeping a safe distance.
Saw a customer in the store without a mask, not cool especially indoors.
Seemed like too many people in the store when I was there.
You must take a shopping cart. I know they are trying to keep a safe distance but it doesn't help I find."
2 months ago,Dana Leonard,"The staff is friendly, store is always clean and the produce is good too. I have always liked this store."

2 months ago,Ryan Ward,I like it!
2 months ago,Colin Campbell,"Fully stocked , Employees extreemly helpfull and very professional."
2 months ago,Adam Nymann,"I found the store was a bit disorganized in terms of directional arrows, and it made it challenging to get around and still be social distanced. However, the selection at the store was great, and the staff here are good."
2 months ago,Michael Ladouceur,"The better of the two no frills options in Barrie. Much bigger selection and fresher products it seems. Be wary of weekends. Because of location and time if week, you almost guaranteed to come across quite a few unsavory customers and large crowds (with little regard to social distancing); yet that's not the stores fault, just a warning."
2 months ago,Marie Sternberg,"A giant thank you to all the staff here for making shopping during COVID a friendly experience. Love the greetings at the door by the cart wipers especially and the friendly cashier that always seems to be there on Tuesday mornings. In fact, all the staff is very helpful. Many thanks, all of you!"

3 months ago,Kerry Weeks,Busy
3 months ago,Susan Yu,"The staff has generally been pretty nice and helpful, but the management is not. In fact recently, I've had the management tell me that I was not allowed to purchase beyond a certain limit of an item,  and that he just told ""my husband"", another random Asian man who I not only do not know,  but didn't even see in the store. Furthermore there was no sign of such a limit,  otherwise I would have happily abided.  Perhaps I should be surprised that No Frills allows this type of behaviour in their stores,  but I'm definitely not in this day and age."
3 months ago,Lisa Jordan,Very friendly lots of fresh produce
3 months ago,William Cox,I didn't find it as good as Walmart as the selection is diminished and the prices are higher but it'll do in a pinch.
3 months ago,Andria Diane,"My friend is embarrassed to write this, but I would want anyone to face the same experience! one of the cashiers at this location at 11am this morning. (December 21st) was not only making fun of a customer, but bullying them about their payment method!! Not only is this against every code of conduct at these work locations, but it's intolerable how a cashier is allowed to speak with you at this location."
3 months ago,Erin Catt,Great prices on food

3 months ago,Rodrigo R,Few people there.
3 months ago,Bob Zuruncle,Good prices on most items. Friendly staff.
3 months ago,Dallis Favret,"There is an employee who has been without a mask for at least my visits in the past two weeks. I understand the employee has a medical exemption to avoid wearing a face covering.

Although the management does not have an option in the employees exemption, they do have options when it comes to making this employee public facing, intermingling, and in contact with the public.

This demonstrates:
1. The management doesn't take this pandemic seriously.
2. The management doesn't care about the health and safety of their customers or the community.

I have been a regular weekly shopper of Joe's No Frills for the past 13 years, that stops today.."

7 months ago,Alexander Faulds,"Went there today to get tomatoes that was in the flyer for the week and is also in next week's fly so you would think they have them.... No some notice that they do not have the tomatoes from the flyer due to deliver issues so why put it in the next week's flyer , asked the manager and he said may not get them for next week either.... Makes me think of Zellers and how that place never had anything in here flyers either were are they now!!!"
