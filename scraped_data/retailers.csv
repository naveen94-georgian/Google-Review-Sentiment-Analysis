Out of every Loblaws I've been to, this one is (by far) the best in presentation and quality. A bit pricier than other neighboring grocers, but for this location, I'd make the sacrifice for things that aren't brand name, like meat/deli.

They like to reduce waste- meaning anything they don't sell in time gets marked down (typically around 50% off) and whatever doesn't sell from that gets made into compost/slop or made as food donations (depending what it is of course).

The meat is fresh, and out of all the places I've tried seafood, theirs seems to be the freshest. The bakery/Patisserie has a delicious variety to choose from and there's even a little cafe at the end of their sushi/hot deli counter.

The beef I have is with the owner (whom I've never met in my time working there). He decided to cut everyone's hours. I thought I could have a future there, but just as I thought I could start making a living, he hired on two new bakery associates and tossed us one 4-hour shift a week. I understand students need work, but what about those who aren't living off of student loans?  I had to pinch pennies and eat small portions just to make sure I had enough to last me the whole month. I couldn't even afford the bus pass to continue working there.

And I'll never let that go. )8<",0.05,0.95,0.0,-0.3804,Negative

Since the pandemic, they've done a wonderful job or regulating the flow of shoppers, creating queues or lines for checkout where a store employee can direct which lane to use, and providing a washing and sanitization station near the entrance.

We've also used this location for the PC Express program a lot, especially since the pandemic. I have to say, the staff on the PC Express team at this Zehrs are phenomenal! If you forget to add an item or two to your order and it's too late to edit your order, they will do their best to accommodate you, sometimes even checking while you wait for pickup (if you're amenable to it) if they have stock. They are always extremely friendly and polite, and really make you feel - whether on the phone, or in-person - appreciated as a customer. I always enjoy my interactions with this team.

Overall, I give this Zehrs location a five for the way the store is run, all the staff who work there, and the measures they have and continue to take to make their customers feel valued.",0.05,0.95,0.0,-0.3804,Negative

They have a bathroom located in the top floor and a starburst in one corner for the thirsty shopper and if your hungry a hot deli on the other side.

Product is easily located and has a general fluidity that works for both customers/consumer/business.

When I point the errors out, cashiers simply re-ring it through at the correct price but without even an apology. This has happened at several visits over the past couple of years. I've also been consistently disappointed throughout the pandemic with employees' behaviour - waiting until forced to to wear masks, and not respecting distance. Very different approach towards customers than I've seen at other stores - even the Zehrs on Bryne is more diligent and obliging.",0.05,0.95,0.0,-0.3804,Negative
