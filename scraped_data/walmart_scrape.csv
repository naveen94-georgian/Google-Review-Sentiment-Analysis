2 hours ago,Gabby,Customer service is decent .... upset that I can‚Äôt purchase some BABY ESSENTIALS since one or two aisles we blocked off due to the new COVID restrictions. Like seriously ? I seriously feel bad for the cashiers trying to figure out what‚Äôs essential or not.
13 hours ago,Fire Ethence,Packed to the brim. Not following covid protocols AT ALL!!! The international students employees and customers REEEEKED!!!!!!! Could smell them all through out the store! Walmart talk to them about personal hygiene PLEASE!!!!
a day ago,Laurel Munshaw,"I don't want to give you any stars right now! someone explain how gardening is essential but shampoo, tampons, diapers, wipes...why are those isles closed off? this covid stuff stopped making sense along time ago."
a week ago,Michael Burnie,"It's a Walmart, so it is what it is. Problem is, this is a pretty bad Walmart as Walmarts go, primarily because shelves are often barren in the grocery and pharmaceutical sections. I've talked about this particular location to my friends that work in management positions at other Walmarts, and they tell me this location is a joke. I send them pictures like this and they can't believe it.

I really like the curbside pickup when they're on time, which is seldom. I don't believe the staff are to blame. I think it's poor management compounding with COVID.

I hate myself for going here but it's convenient and they do actually have good prices on some stuff."
2 weeks ago,Ian McLean,"For over 3 days they have been promising to fill my prescription for anti seizure medication. Everyday it's we will have it filled by tomorrow. When asking a pharmacist if they are acually fill it or not, I was hung up on. Very unrespective employees and management. Management is included because, I called back to file a complaint. Management placed me on hold for 20 mins. Then the call was picked up and hung up. They don't care as long as they get your money. Shoppers drug mart got the same prescription filled in less then 30 mins. Wasn't fun not having my meds for a day. So I won't be going into a Walmart for anything anymore."
2 weeks ago,Battlecat,"Ah Wally mart, the worst store around for service and price.  Go with Amazon if you have a choice."
a month ago,Brittany J,Always very busy with customers being far to close to one another. There is no proper control / cleanliness over self-checkout with the amount of staff on hand. Customers are rushing upto the machines before staff can even sanitize them between use.
a month ago,cole gaming and trophy guides 7,Amazing walmart by far the best one I've seen
a month ago,Heather Gosse,",i injured my finger at Walmart on Bayfield St and reported it to them and  the store had no PRODACALL for this, my finger swelled up and immediately bruised . They brushed me off and said there was nothing else to be done. I have photos of my finger, which is still bruised and my nail will fall off soo. THANKS FOR CARING WALMART"
a month ago,Anthony Lancaster,"I had an interview with this Walmart on Thursday February 25th 2021. As I waited to be interviewed a number of employees walked by not wearing their masks properly, and I saw two managers without one. When it came time to do the interview it turned out to be a group interview with 6 other individuals. When we were brought into the back and placed in the training room, which had a small table were we could not social distance. When I asked the manager how could this be loud I was told it was a none issue yet as of February 14th they had an employee test positive for Covid-19. Walmart is placing your life at risk so they can make money."
a month ago,Carol F,"My experiences shopping in this store have always been enjoyable. Shelves are always well stocked and the employees are very courteous and pleasant.  However, my experience with an employee in the produce section today was not so good.  I dropped something on the floor and I reached out to the closest employee for their assistance.  Not a word was spoken from the employee, just a disgusted look. Needless to say I felt terrible, but this person made me feel even worse."
a month ago,Tim D,"Update: Loss of price match and pandemic issues have forced me and others to shop where items are more affordable. Was always worth trip to Walmart. Not anymore, sadly.

This Walmart has been so supportive and helpful to me and others during this sudden and huge crisis. The staff continue to work hard and with positive attitudes. I'm greeted with smiles and ""good morning's"" as always has been. It means a lot to me and I'm sure others. Sam Walton would be very proud of Walmart Barrie North. Thank you all..üòá

Massive transformation!! This Walmart rocks!! Great staff, lots of room to navigate my scooter throughout. Fresh product and well stocked. Cashiers smile and do thier best to help, very important!! Finally.... price match is so important and allows me to eat healthier foods with limited fixed income. Thanks to all..üôèüëç"
2 months ago,Mike Mitro,Place is dirty. Staff seem really lackadaisical. I'd avoid this place

2 months ago,Patty Ching,"This store is not following provincial guidelines regarding covid 19 . Shoppers are packed in here all afternoon. They are not counting customers.
Lately this store reeks like body odor. It is really disgusting."
3 months ago,Patrick Wong,"January 9 2021 9:30 AM a maskless couple with a child was shopping at  Walmart. A lady could confronted them. A scene in sued with the maskless lady screaming. A code yellow was called, and management came running. The end result is nothing was done because of the maskless couple sight medical reason. I was never was a fan of Walmart but they put my 80-year-old mother at risk by doing nothing."
3 months ago,Stephanie Speer,Very nice customer service on the phone in crafts. She was quick friendly and very informative
3 months ago,Anthony Medina,"Good staff & clean environment. If you consciously decided to come here, chances are they'll have what you need. Their international food section has also grown quite a bit over the years."
3 months ago,Rachel Hebert,"So disappointed. I forgot my mask at home, asked if they had one to give to me. They refused and told me to leave, then kicked my grandmother in the shins. Never going back here again"
4 months ago,kadeem skf,Very displeased with the pick up service. I waited in my car for over an hour. The excuse was your under staffed. This issue needs to be fixed.
4 months ago,Elena Conita,"We are so happy with the friendly staff, i enjoy coming to shop."
4 months ago,ChocolateMonkeh,"I always go to this Walmart since the one on the south side is a nightmare. The staff are usually friendly and you can  always find a ton of them around when you have a question.
The shelves are empty way too often though, and they are not enforcing covid measures at all these days. It doesn't seem like they are controlling the number of people in the store since I'm always squeezing through crowded aisles, and they don't enforce the arrows. I see customers without masks once in a  while and no one says anything! I actually forgot my mask once and walked in  passed by 3 employees who didn't say a word! Once I realized, I flew out of there lol"
4 months ago,Betsy Attkisson,Walmart always has everything u need .wait a minute
5 months ago,lifeislove notcolour,great place to pick up inexpensive stuff when you're in a rush!! so glad they didnt fllip out during the pandemic and change their store hours like the rest of the world ...
5 months ago,Mark Cutter,The shelves are always clean. And the phone barely gets answered. Its frustrating but I live in the area and I like the prices so I'll always come back. I just wish that when they advertise something is for sale they order enough stock.
5 months ago,Ethan Hu,Don't park in a RV here won't tell you if you are going to be towed or not. They said that because the smart center owns the parking lot. Even though other Walmart's are owned by smart center and will tell you if you can park Barrie Walmart won't give an answer.
5 months ago,Brennon Oster,"Never ever restocked, unorganized, bad Walmart in general"
5 months ago,Jennifer Von G.,"The cashier at night (around 9pm) was unfriendly and felt uncomfortable to aporoach.... Almost as though she wasn't even speaking to a lady... Nice standards

Im a lesbian and I don't even want to speak to the girls here that work at night.

Oh, and FYI they really set off my overly-religious-peoples' radar here at night btw. My instincts tell me of a christian persuasion.  With a street culture on the side :)

people wear sweatpants around here :s  Cars often have headlights out around here?  Weird.."
6 months ago,R S,"Just like last time this will be the start of the outbreak in our region again this time......not limiting people in the stores and being proactive is going to get us shutdown again and I hope this time that this place goes down.
No one and I repeat no one respects their one direction signs and staff and patrons don't care.   I wish places like this would take covid 2020 more seriously.   Mark my words it's only a matter of time"
6 months ago,Julia Lollipop,"Employee came within inches of me, coming the wrong way down the aisle with NO MASK ON..  TWICE ..  she wore a face shield .. which protects her, maybe, but not me!  So Rude!"

6 months ago,Rachel R,"Called this store to ask a question regarding a product prior to going. Was on hold for 10 minutes and then the employee came back on to say ""sorry why were you calling?"", then had to wait another 10 minutes, until I just decided to hang up.

Location is just like any other Walmart."
