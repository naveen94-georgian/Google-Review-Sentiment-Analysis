4 days ago,Jenny,"We get curbside pick up currently and its very quick, easy and friendly."
6 days ago,Lana Kis,"We usually cannot afford to buy food from such an expensive store.  But today we came to it because there was a huge queue in the neighboring wallmart, where we usually buy food.  We were shocked that there were so many expired, spoiled food in such a luxury, expensive store.  Berry, dragon fruit, star fruit, they were all spoiled.  they were wrinkled and stained.  My kids asked for a coconut.  It was difficult to choose not rotten, most of the coconuts had mold.  I chose the best one, but when I opened it at home, it turned out that it was rotten.  Disgusting!  The managers of this store are not doing their job.  I have not seen such a shame in the most inexpensive Sshop.  Shame!!!  Never again !"
a week ago,robert mansfield,Went here to pick up some food for meal prep. Store had everything that I was looking for. Only downside was at cash. The belt was not cleaned off after the previous person had paid and the cashier was reading some paperwork while I was waiting for them to scan my items. They seemed to be more interested in what they were reading than customer service.

2 months ago,Shirley Morrison,I was looking for the  Knorr1klm.  soup base yellow can red lid. No store that I went to had that product.  I saw online that Loblaws had it.  When I went there to my disappointment the gentleman help me look for it and it was not in the store.  I give Loblaws credit for not giving up.  When I asked the manager about it she sent me to her assistant manager and there was one more place to look and he found it. I purchased the product I was looking for. Thank you Loblaws for not giving up. And a special thank you to Glen for being so good and trying to help me find the product.

2 months ago,kenny hunter,To expensive but otherwise good
2 months ago,ChocolateMonkeh,"Usually come here for their bakery section, breads and antipasto. Its always clean and organized but on all occasions that I've been here I've encountered at least 1 really rude worker. -Today was my birthday and we picked up a plain vanilla cake, it was half frozen and for loblaws' reputation I wasn't expecting it to taste like a boxed cake, but it did. Could have probably gotten a better one for less at Walmart. Other than that I'd definitely keep coming back. I love their plant section as well."
2 months ago,Miranda Grundsten,"Tasty sandwiches, clean, lots of variety, but bought moldy brie cheese so products should be more carefully inspected."

4 months ago,Dana Leonard,This store has everything and the staff is excellent
4 months ago,cassandra wellington,"I bought two dozen chestnuts last week.  I usually slice chestnuts open and roast them in the oven, but about half of them were so hard I couldn't even slice them. The ones that I could cut slice turned out to be rotten on the inside or would not peel at all after roasting. I ended up being able to eat 3 chestnuts and the rest went into the green bin. What a disappointment, especially since they're a seasonal item that I really look forward to."
4 months ago,chris stix,Wayyyyyyyyy to expensive.
4 months ago,Mike Owen,"The prepared foods in the deli area are better than almost any fast food restaurant. Primarily the wings, fingers, scalloped taters, all really great quality. Great staff as well. Just nice clean tidy respectfull place to shop.unlike the big store next door that throws good food away they reduce food to enjoy today, instead of throwing it away. For a family budget it's a really great option to buy canadian."

4 months ago,Matthew Lazzaro,Good hot plate deals. Love the sandwiches as well
4 months ago,johann isopp,The vegetable section is outragious! Filthy and picked over. The vegatables are days if not weeks old. The prices are criminal. They have done a good job merchandising for the upcoming holidays.
5 months ago,Donald Ryner,Got to love the selection and freshness!
5 months ago,Caleb Ward,Very safe in the covid time and the prices are fair as well
5 months ago,Christina Savoy,In and out in 10 the way I like it
5 months ago,lifeislove notcolour,decent place but needs to value their employees more ... ironic considering they own all the groceries shops and sell the same thing at different prices in their other shops ...strange place indeed ....
5 months ago,William Blackstock,line ups tend to be long at this location.
5 months ago,amie mim,"The safety protocols I must say have been the best thus far..in luding not only sanitize stations but also wash basins..and also noticed they keep traffic going one way..u can  only enter one door and only exit a different one door..
Although to be honest I have found the most processing gouging there..
Which in of it alone is wrong in every aspects of life during these tiring times"
5 months ago,Rj King,Nice store. Little more expensive than others

6 months ago,Caroline Tutakiewicz,Such a clean and well stocked store. Staff is super friendly and its a great experience overall.
6 months ago,Dee Sans,"A clean grocery store with lots of options to choose from. They have a decent selection of foods for different cultures :) . It can be a bit pricey but that can be anywhere. Another added highlight is that they have a Magnotta winery boutique where you can pick up a nice wine (and for a really nice price point!) So if you're planning to host a dinner or don't want to go empty-handed to someone's party, this is your one-stop shop."
6 months ago,Soren Vaerum,Great selection. They do not have a good covid plan in terms of check out. Rather than utilizing multiple line ups at the cashier's with social distancing they enforce a single line. This often causes long wait times.
6 months ago,Charlotte Brethour,"Loblaws , is always safe because they clean between customers. No many of the other grocery stores do. Thank you for making my shopping experience less stressful."
6 months ago,Naomi ROSS,Great choices

6 months ago,Ramandeep Kaur,Amazing tastes!! A quick yumm snack and finger licking cake quality!!
6 months ago,Tyra Wadman,"BEWARE THE KARENS!!!

Out of every Loblaws I've been to, this one is (by far) the best in presentation and quality. A bit pricier than other neighboring grocers, but for this location, I'd make the sacrifice for things that aren't brand name, like meat/deli.

They like to reduce waste- meaning anything they don't sell in time gets marked down (typically around 50% off) and whatever doesn't sell from that gets made into compost/slop or made as food donations (depending what it is of course).

The meat is fresh, and out of all the places I've tried seafood, theirs seems to be the freshest. The bakery/Patisserie has a delicious variety to choose from and there's even a little cafe at the end of their sushi/hot deli counter.

The beef I have is with the owner (whom I've never met in my time working there). He decided to cut everyone's hours. I thought I could have a future there, but just as I thought I could start making a living, he hired on two new bakery associates and tossed us one 4-hour shift a week. I understand students need work, but what about those who aren't living off of student loans?  I had to pinch pennies and eat small portions just to make sure I had enough to last me the whole month. I couldn't even afford the bus pass to continue working there.

And I'll never let that go. )8<"
6 months ago,Una,I find loblaws way too expensive especially for veggies
6 months ago,safia akhtar,We can find different varieties of seafood
6 months ago,PAUL SMITH,"Too many people in the store, line ups a mile long.  I left without a purchase."
6 months ago,Tara Alexander,"A WIDE selection to suit every customer. Was nearly blown away by the extensive produce display and the clever layout. The cheese fridges are impressive to say the least as is the patisserie.
Advise to not shop if hungry. No need to ever head south with the options at this location."
6 months ago,–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π,Everything is fine but on selfcheckout they can mount a screens between stations. Lines move very slow.
